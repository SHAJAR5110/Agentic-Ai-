# Reasoning vs Standard Models in Agentic AI

Agentic AI systems are designed to act autonomously, making decisions and taking actions to achieve goals. Within agentic AI, there is a distinction between **reasoning models** and **standard models**.

## Reasoning Models

Reasoning models are AI systems capable of logical inference, planning, and multi-step problem solving. They can break down complex tasks, adapt to new information, and justify their decisions. These models often use techniques such as symbolic reasoning, chain-of-thought prompting, or explicit planning algorithms.

**Example:**  
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Large Language Models:** When solving math problems, the model explains each step before arriving at the answer.
- **AlphaZero:** Uses search and planning to play chess and Go, reasoning about future moves.

## Standard Models

Standard models are typically trained to map inputs to outputs directly, without explicit reasoning or planning. They excel at pattern recognition, classification, and regression tasks, but may struggle with tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or adaptation.

**Example:**  
- **Image Classification Models (ResNet, VGG):** Classify images based on learned patterns.
- **Text Classification Models:** Assign sentiment labels to text without explaining the reasoning.

## Key Differences

| Aspect                | Reasoning Models                          | Standard Models                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Approach              | Logical inference, planning, stepwise     | Direct input-output mapping            |
| Adaptability          | High; can handle novel situations         | Limited; relies on training data       |
| Transparency          | Can explain decisions and steps           | Often a "black box"                    |
| Example Task          | Solving math problems with explanations   | Classifying images                     |
| Use in Agentic AI     | Enables autonomous, goal-directed agents  | Supports perception and recognition    |
